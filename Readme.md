## 📌 Overview
The **Egyptian Universities Management System** is a comprehensive platform designed to manage university, faculty, and department data, specifically tailored to help high school students choose the right academic path based on multiple criteria.

## 🎯 Main Objective

- ✅ Easily compare universities and faculties
- ✅ Apply advanced filtering based on disciplines, degrees, tuition fees, and more
- ✅ Export results as a **PDF** for future reference or sharing with parents and advisors
- ✅ **Fully responsive** for seamless experience across all devices (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile)

## ✨ Key Features

### 1️⃣ Advanced Filtering System (High-Precision Filtering)
A powerful filtering system allowing students to find the most suitable academic programs with precision:

🔍 **Filter by Department Type** (Engineering, Medicine, Business, Arts, etc.)

🎓 **Filter by Degree Type** (Bachelor’s, Master’s, Ph.D.)

💰 **Filter by Tuition Fee Range** (Set minimum and maximum tuition costs)

🔎 **Smart Search** (Search by name or keywords)

### 2️⃣ Export Results to PDF
📄 **Convert search results into a well-structured and clean PDF** including:
- University & faculty name
- Available disciplines
- Tuition fees
- Admission requirements
- 🖨️ **Print or save for later review**

### 3️⃣ Fully Responsive & Modern UI
📱 **Adaptive layout** that works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
🎨 **Clean and intuitive design** powered by TailwindCSS.
